# ActiveDirectory Image Fetch API

## <p style="text-align:center">API Project</p>

**The Opportunity**: All employee photos are housed in Active Directory and not a location others can easily access. Building out an API to do the image fetches and return the image as a blob. 

**The Solution**: Build out a .NET Web Handler that can fetch employee images from Active Directory.

**The Enhancements**: Added a text to Image converter which allowed me to display the text "no photo" as an image return. This ensured the API always had a return value.

## Links, IPs, Paths, basically anything identifiable and unique to the workplace has been edited out.
